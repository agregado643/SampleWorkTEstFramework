Introduction

Welcome to the module on the Test Automation Framework for Invoice Processing. In this session, we will delve into how the framework utilizes dynamic test cases and templates to efficiently test the invoice processing system. We will cover the purpose and functionality of two key components within this framework:

DynamicTestCases.py

FileUtility.robot

Moreover, we will discuss the role of test data CSV files in automating test case generation and execution.

Section 1: Dynamic Test Case Generation

1.1 Overview of DynamicTestCases.py

DynamicTestCases.py is a Python script that plays a pivotal role in the test automation framework. It is designed to generate test cases dynamically during runtime. This means that test cases are not static; they are created onthefly based on certain parameters and inputs provided at the time of test execution.

1.2 Purpose and Functionality

The purpose of DynamicTestCases.py is to enhance the flexibility and scalability of the test suite. It allows for:

Adaptability: Adjusting to new test scenarios without the need to write additional test scripts for each case.

Efficiency: Reducing the time and effort required to maintain test cases.

Customization: Catering to specific test data and scenarios by generating targeted test cases.

 Section 2: The Role of FileUtility.robot

 2.1 Overview of FileUtility.robot

FileUtility.robot is a component of the Robot Framework, a keyworddriven test automation framework. It contains test templates and serves as the entry point for test execution. This file is responsible for orchestrating the dynamic creation of test cases during runtime.

 2.2 Purpose and Functionality

The key functions of FileUtility.robot include:

Housing all the test templates that are utilized by the Robot Framework test cases.

Taking an external test data CSV file as a parameter to start the dynamic test case creation process.

Serving as the interface between the test data and the test execution engine.

 Section 3: Understanding Test Data CSV Files

 3.1 The Purpose of Test Data CSV Files

Test data CSV files are crucial for the dynamic generation of test cases. These files:

Contain Rows of Data: Each row represents a unique test case with specific parameters and expected results.

Drive Test Case Creation: The data from the CSV file is read and used to create test cases dynamically.

Ensure Comprehensive Coverage: By providing a series of different test scenarios through the CSV file, the framework can validate the invoice processing system against a wide array of conditions.

 3.2 The Structure of Test Data CSV Files

A typical test data CSV file for invoice processing might include columns for:

filename,invoicenumber,AccountNumber,PeriodStartDate,PeriodEndDate,BillDate,DueDate,BillPreviousBalance,BillPastDueBalance,BillPaymentReceived,BillBalance,carrier,lines

Each row in the CSV file would provide a different set of values, thus representing a distinct test case.

 Section 4: Robot Framework TemplateBased Functionality

 4.1 Overview of TemplateBased Testing

Robot Framework offers a powerful templatebased testing approach. This feature allows testers to:

Define a test template with keywords that represent steps in a test.

Execute the same sequence of steps with different data inputs.

Enhance readability and maintainability of test cases.

 4.2 How It Works

In templatebased testing, a test case is defined once using keywords. For each iteration, different data sets from the test data CSV file are passed into the template, leading to multiple test cases being executed with varied inputs.

 Section 5: Execution Process

 5.1 Test Case Script File

The caller of the test template is a test case script file, which includes:

Setup Section: Configuration details for the test execution environment.

Template Call Keyword: A keyword from the FileUtility.robot template that initiates test execution.

 5.2 Preprocessing and Execution

Before test execution, the test data is preprocessed to ensure that it is in the correct format and structure for the test cases. Once preprocessing is complete, the template's keyword is triggered to start the execution of the dynamically created test cases.

 The test automation framework for invoice processing relies on DynamicTestCases.py and FileUtility.robot to create and execute dynamic test cases using test data from CSV files. This approach ensures a robust and scalable testing process,


 

In this example, Process Invoice is the keyword called from the FileUtility.robot that starts execution with the provided parameters.
